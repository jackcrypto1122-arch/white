# 01 · Executive Summary

Financial markets have historically been designed around human decision-makers. Humans observe information, form a view, decide when capital should move, and instruct infrastructure to execute those decisions. Even highly automated systems have generally been built as tools around that same model.

Tokenization changes the execution surface. When financial assets move onchain, pricing, liquidity, settlement, and capital movement become accessible to programmable infrastructure. At the same time, autonomous systems are becoming capable of continuously observing markets, reasoning over changing conditions, and proposing actions without waiting for a human operator.

Blackwood Protocol is being built for the intersection of those two shifts.

The protocol is designed as an **agentic execution layer for tokenized equities**, initially focused on Robinhood Chain and Stock Token markets. Rather than placing unrestricted trading authority inside a single model, Blackwood separates market intelligence, strategy logic, risk, simulation, and execution into distinct layers.

At the center of the system is a normalized market-state engine. It combines information from underlying equity markets, onchain reference infrastructure, executable decentralized-exchange liquidity, market sessions, volatility, oracle state, and current exposure. Specialized agents consume the same validated state while reasoning over different forms of market opportunity.

Blackwood's initial strategy network is built around three autonomous execution systems:

**Mean Reversion Agent.** Models temporary dislocations between Stock Token execution prices and their reference structure, then evaluates whether convergence opportunities remain executable after liquidity, volatility, slippage, and risk constraints.

**Cross-Pool Arbitrage Agent.** Continuously compares executable prices across fragmented liquidity surfaces, evaluates route depth and trade size, subtracts transaction costs and price impact, and identifies cross-pool opportunities that remain economically viable at settlement.

**Adaptive Liquidity Engine.** Treats liquidity as active capital. It evaluates volatility, inventory, active range position, fee generation, and rebalance economics to determine when concentrated liquidity should remain in place, widen, recenter, or withdraw.

These agents do not directly control capital. They generate execution proposals.

Every proposal must pass through a shared deterministic Risk Engine, transaction simulation, state revalidation, and execution pipeline before it can settle onchain.

Blackwood is therefore not designed as a collection of independent trading bots. It is designed as a coordinated execution network in which specialized intelligence operates above shared market, risk, and settlement infrastructure.

# 02 · The Shift to Agentic Markets

## 2.1 Markets Were Built for People

The modern trading stack assumes that the primary market participant is human.

Market-data terminals present information to people. Order-entry systems wait for people. Risk controls are frequently designed around a person or institution approving capital movement. Interfaces are optimized around clicks, confirmations, charts, alerts, and manual intervention.

Automation has existed for decades, but most automation still operates inside a predefined set of instructions. A system may execute an order when a threshold is crossed, rebalance on a schedule, or follow a deterministic market-making rule. The automation is powerful, but the surrounding market infrastructure remains fundamentally human-oriented.

Agentic systems introduce a different model.

An autonomous market system can maintain a continuous representation of market conditions, evaluate multiple sources of information, generate a proposed action, reconsider that action as conditions change, and continue operating after execution.

The important shift is not simply faster trading.

It is the possibility that the market participant itself becomes programmable.

## 2.2 Tokenization Expands the Execution Surface

Tokenized financial assets create a new environment for automated and autonomous systems.

When an asset exists within blockchain infrastructure, it can interact with programmable settlement, decentralized liquidity, smart contracts, and machine-readable market state. The execution environment becomes directly accessible to software without requiring every action to pass through a traditional graphical interface.

For tokenized equity markets, this creates an especially interesting convergence.

The referenced asset exists within traditional market structure, while the tokenized representation can trade within onchain liquidity. That creates multiple relevant price surfaces, multiple execution environments, and new forms of market fragmentation.

A serious autonomous system therefore cannot treat a Stock Token as simply another ERC-20 asset with a price feed.

It has to understand the relationship between the underlying market, the token's reference structure, the liquidity actually available onchain, and the conditions under which each source of information is valid.

## 2.3 From Intelligence to Autonomous Capital

AI and agentic systems are rapidly improving at analysis. They can process large datasets, monitor changing environments, and reason over information at a scale that would be difficult for a single human operator.

But intelligence alone does not create an execution system.

A market agent must answer questions such as:

- Is the reference price recent enough to use?
- Is the underlying market currently trading?
- Has the underlying asset halted?
- Is the Stock Token's corporate-action state normal?
- What price can actually be executed for the intended trade size?
- How much price impact will the trade create?
- Does the expected edge survive pool fees and transaction costs?
- How much exposure already exists to the asset?
- Has volatility changed since the signal was produced?
- Would the transaction succeed if submitted now?
- Is the proposed action still valid immediately before signing?

These questions sit between intelligence and capital.

Blackwood Protocol is built around that layer.

# 03 · Blackwood Protocol

## 3.1 Protocol Overview

Blackwood Protocol is an agentic execution layer designed for autonomous systems operating across tokenized equity markets.

Its architecture separates five core responsibilities:

1. **Market state** establishes a normalized view of the environment.
2. **Agents** reason over that state and produce execution proposals.
3. **Risk** determines whether those proposals are permissible.
4. **Simulation** verifies that the intended transaction remains executable.
5. **Execution** signs, submits, settles, and accounts for approved actions.

The system follows a simple principle:

> **Agents propose. Risk approves. Execution settles.**

This separation is fundamental.

An agent may identify an opportunity and still be denied execution because liquidity changed, the reference became unsafe, exposure is too high, the trade no longer clears simulation, or the expected edge disappeared before settlement.

The intelligence is allowed to be adaptive.

The boundaries around capital are deterministic.

## 3.2 Design Principles

### Specialized Intelligence

Blackwood does not assume one general model should make every market decision. Different agents can specialize in different dimensions of market structure while sharing the same infrastructure underneath.

### Shared Market Reality

Every strategy consumes the same normalized market state. Individual agents do not independently redefine reference prices, market sessions, oracle validity, or liquidity conditions.

### Execution-Aware Decision Making

Signals are not treated as trades. A valid signal must survive actual execution conditions before capital moves.

### Deterministic Risk Boundaries

Strategy logic is separated from risk authority. Agents cannot independently expand their own exposure limits or bypass safety checks.

### Simulation Before Settlement

Where possible, transactions are simulated before they are signed. A transaction that fails simulation or violates execution constraints is rejected before settlement.

### Modular Architecture

Market-data adapters, risk modules, strategy engines, and execution components are designed as separable modules. New strategies can be introduced without rebuilding the entire execution stack.

### Onchain Settlement

The final movement of assets occurs onchain. Where a strategy benefits from atomic execution guarantees, purpose-built smart contracts can enforce those guarantees at settlement.

## 3.3 What Blackwood Is Not

Blackwood is not designed as:

- a chatbot connected directly to an unrestricted wallet;
- a single general-purpose model deciding every trade;
- a copy-trading interface;
- a generic portfolio dashboard;
- a new oracle network;
- a new automated market maker;
- a public pooled investment vault at launch.

The protocol's focus is narrower and more foundational: **market intelligence, autonomous strategy execution, deterministic risk, and onchain settlement.**

## 4.2 Market State Engine

The Market State Engine is the shared intelligence substrate of Blackwood Protocol.

Its purpose is to convert multiple market-data surfaces into a consistent, strategy-independent representation of the current environment. This avoids a common failure mode in automated trading systems where each strategy independently fetches, interprets, and validates its own version of market truth.

A normalized state may contain:

```ts
type MarketState = {
  symbol: string
  tokenAddress: Address

  robinhood: {
    bid: number
    ask: number
    midpoint: number
    currentMultiplier: number
    tokenEquivalentMidpoint: number
    tradingHalted: boolean
    allDayTradable: boolean
    generatedAt: number
  }

  reference: {
    price: number
    updatedAt: number
    stale: boolean
    safe: boolean
  }

  sessionState:
    | "regular"
    | "pre-market"
    | "post-market"
    | "overnight"
    | "closed"

  venues: {
    venue: string
    buyQuotes: Quote[]
    sellQuotes: Quote[]
    liquidity?: number
  }[]

  volatility: {
    shortTerm: number
    mediumTerm: number
  }
}
```

The exact implementation can evolve, but the architectural requirement remains the same: **strategies consume validated state rather than independently reconstructing the market.**

## 4.3 Agent Runtime

Each autonomous strategy runs as part of a persistent execution runtime.

The runtime is responsible for:

- consuming updated market state;
- evaluating strategy-specific conditions;
- generating proposed actions;
- forwarding those actions to the Risk Engine;
- receiving approval or rejection;
- monitoring open strategy state;
- responding to system-wide circuit breakers.

This runtime is intentionally separated from the user-facing API.

The API serves human and application requests. The worker runtime operates continuously against markets.

## 4.4 Risk Engine

The Risk Engine exists outside individual strategy logic.

This matters because an autonomous strategy should not be responsible for defining the same boundaries it is attempting to optimize against.

Risk evaluation may include:

- canonical asset verification;
- enabled strategy and asset checks;
- maximum trade size;
- strategy-level exposure;
- system-wide exposure;
- wallet balance;
- market liquidity;
- expected slippage;
- reference-data validity;
- current market session;
- oracle state;
- transaction simulation;
- RPC health;
- daily loss thresholds;
- repeated transaction failures;
- circuit-breaker state.

A strategy can be directionally correct and still be rejected by risk.

That is expected behavior.

## 4.5 Execution Engine

Once an action passes risk validation, the Execution Engine turns a strategy proposal into a settlement attempt.

The execution lifecycle is:

```text
STRATEGY EVALUATION
        ↓
ACTION PROPOSAL
        ↓
RISK APPROVAL
        ↓
TRANSACTION BUILD
        ↓
SIMULATION
        ↓
CRITICAL STATE RECHECK
        ↓
SIGN
        ↓
SUBMIT
        ↓
WAIT FOR RECEIPT
        ↓
ACCOUNT + UPDATE POSITION
```

The state recheck immediately before signing is important.

Onchain opportunities can disappear quickly. A route that was profitable when first identified may no longer be valid after several blocks, an RPC delay, a liquidity change, or a reference update.

Blackwood therefore treats execution as a process, not a single function call.

---

# 05 · Market Intelligence Layer

## 5.1 Price Is Not a Single Number

One of the central ideas in Blackwood's architecture is that a tokenized equity can have multiple relevant prices at the same time.

For execution, three surfaces matter most.

### 1. Underlying Market Surface

Robinhood's Stock Token data infrastructure can provide information related to the referenced underlying equity, including bid and ask data, asset metadata, corporate-action multipliers, and trading status.

This surface helps establish what is happening in the referenced market.

### 2. Onchain Reference Surface

Onchain reference infrastructure provides a value that smart contracts and autonomous systems can consume directly.

This surface must be evaluated alongside freshness and safety conditions rather than treated as permanently valid.

### 3. Executable Liquidity Surface

The executable price is the price at which Blackwood can actually trade a specific amount through available liquidity.

It depends on:

- venue;
- direction;
- trade size;
- pool fee;
- liquidity depth;
- current pool state;
- price impact;
- routing.

These three surfaces can be close without being identical.

```text
Underlying Equity Midpoint       $185.10
Onchain Reference                $185.07
Executable Buy                   $185.42
Executable Sell                  $184.81
```

For an autonomous execution system, the difference matters.

The system cannot trade the theoretical reference price. It trades the executable market.

## 5.2 Multiplier-Aware Pricing

Stock Token markets may incorporate corporate-action multipliers.

When comparing data from different surfaces, Blackwood must normalize values correctly before evaluating a deviation.

A simplified representation is:

```text
Token-Equivalent Underlying Value
=
Raw Underlying Midpoint × Current Multiplier
```

This value can then be compared against the appropriate onchain reference and executable market.

Using raw underlying pricing without the correct multiplier could create a false signal around corporate actions or other multiplier changes.

## 5.3 Session-Aware Market State

Traditional equity markets behave differently across sessions.

Blackwood therefore distinguishes between:

- regular trading;
- pre-market;
- post-market;
- overnight trading where supported;
- closed market periods.

A statistical relationship that is normal during regular hours may be abnormal overnight, and vice versa.

For that reason, strategy statistics should not blindly combine observations across fundamentally different market regimes.

## 5.4 Liquidity-Aware Pricing

Displayed spot prices are insufficient for execution decisions.

Blackwood evaluates quotes at actual trade sizes.

For example:

```text
$100
$250
$500
$1,000
$2,500
$5,000
```

The economically best route can change with size.

A market may display an apparent 40 basis-point spread at negligible size while offering no profitable execution at $5,000 due to depth and price impact.

Blackwood's agents reason about **executable surfaces**, not screenshots.

## 5.5 Volatility and Historical State

Market state also includes historical context.

Short-term and medium-term volatility estimates allow agents to distinguish between a normal deviation and one occurring inside a materially different market regime.

Historical snapshots also allow Blackwood to evaluate:

- rolling spreads;
- session-specific distributions;
- liquidity changes;
- opportunity frequency;
- strategy performance;
- execution quality.

This information is stored for later analysis and calibration rather than relying entirely on live state.

---

# 06 · Autonomous Agent Network

Blackwood's initial architecture is built around three specialized autonomous execution systems.

They are intentionally different.

One reasons about convergence.

One reasons about fragmented execution.

One reasons about liquidity deployment.

What makes them part of the same protocol is the infrastructure beneath them.

## 6.1 Mean Reversion Agent

### Market Thesis

Tokenized equity execution prices may temporarily diverge from their reference structure.

These deviations can emerge because of differences in onchain liquidity, participant flow, market sessions, volatility, and the speed at which separate markets incorporate information.

The Mean Reversion Agent attempts to identify deviations that are statistically meaningful and executable.

It does not assume every difference should converge.

### Spread Construction

A simplified spread can be represented as:

```text
Spread
=
Executable DEX Price − Reference Price
```

and:

```text
Spread %
=
(Executable DEX Price − Reference Price)
─────────────────────────────────────────
              Reference Price
```

A rolling standardized deviation can then be represented as:

```text
          Current Spread − Rolling Mean
Z = ─────────────────────────────────────────
              Rolling Standard Deviation
```

The formula is simple.

The context around it is not.

The rolling distribution should be conditioned on relevant market state such as session, volatility, liquidity, and data validity.

### Entry Logic

A potential entry may require:

- valid reference state;
- safe oracle conditions;
- acceptable agreement between independent reference surfaces;
- underlying market not halted;
- sufficient executable liquidity;
- minimum deviation;
- statistically meaningful spread;
- acceptable volatility;
- approved position size;
- successful transaction simulation.

The exact thresholds are strategy configuration and are not defined as universal constants in the protocol specification.

### Exit Logic

A position may exit when:

- the spread normalizes;
- a take-profit condition is reached;
- a stop-loss condition is reached;
- maximum holding time expires;
- reference data becomes unsafe;
- the underlying market halts;
- liquidity deteriorates materially;
- a strategy or protocol circuit breaker activates.

### Why Execution Matters

A statistical deviation is not an edge if it cannot be executed.

The Mean Reversion Agent therefore operates on executable prices rather than relying solely on theoretical midpoints.

The distinction is central to Blackwood's design.

## 6.2 Cross-Pool Arbitrage Agent

### Market Thesis

Liquidity fragments.

The same Stock Token can trade through multiple pools, fee tiers, and execution surfaces. At any point in time, the effective price available for the same asset can differ across those venues.

The Cross-Pool Arbitrage Agent searches for cases where that fragmentation creates a positive executable edge.

### Executable Route Analysis

The agent does not compare displayed pool spot prices.

It requests or reconstructs executable quotes for the actual trade amount.

For a two-leg route:

```text
STARTING CAPITAL
      ↓
BUY / ACQUIRE ON VENUE A
      ↓
SELL / DISPOSE ON VENUE B
      ↓
ENDING CAPITAL
```

The opportunity can be summarized as:

```text
Expected Net Edge
=
Gross Route Profit
− Pool Fees
− Price Impact
− Estimated Gas
− Safety Margin
```

Only the net result matters.

### Multi-Size Optimization

Execution size is itself part of the strategy.

An apparent spread may be profitable at $500 but unprofitable at $5,000.

Blackwood can evaluate a ladder of trade sizes and estimate the size at which expected net profit is maximized subject to risk constraints.

### Simulation

Before execution, the route is simulated.

If the path reverts, produces unacceptable output, or falls below the required profit threshold, the transaction is rejected.

### Atomic Settlement

Some cross-pool execution paths benefit from atomic settlement.

A purpose-built execution contract can enforce:

1. starting balance is recorded;
2. the first venue interaction executes;
3. the second venue interaction executes;
4. the ending balance is measured;
5. the transaction succeeds only if ending value satisfies the minimum required profit;
6. otherwise the entire transaction reverts.

This is an execution guarantee, not a strategy engine.

The scanner, sizing logic, opportunity detection, risk checks, and route selection remain offchain.

### UniswapX

Intent-based systems such as UniswapX should not be modeled as ordinary AMM pools inside direct-call atomic arbitrage logic.

Blackwood may use route infrastructure where it improves normal execution, but the protocol distinguishes between direct liquidity venues and intent/auction-based execution systems.

## 6.3 Adaptive Liquidity Engine

### Market Thesis

Concentrated liquidity improves capital efficiency by allowing liquidity providers to allocate capital around selected price ranges.

The trade-off is that the position becomes sensitive to changing price, volatility, and inventory.

A static range can therefore become inefficient as market conditions evolve.

The Adaptive Liquidity Engine treats LP capital as an actively managed position.

### State Variables

The engine may evaluate:

- current price;
- range lower bound;
- range upper bound;
- distance from range edges;
- volatility;
- token inventory;
- stablecoin inventory;
- accumulated fees;
- estimated rebalance cost;
- recent price behavior;
- reference-market condition.

### Adaptive Range Logic

A simplified conceptual model is:

```text
Lower Volatility   → Narrower Range
Higher Volatility  → Wider Range
Extreme Conditions → Reduce / Withdraw / Pause
```

The exact range widths are not protocol constants.

They are configuration parameters that should be calibrated empirically against live market behavior.

### Rebalancing

Entering the outer region of an LP range should not automatically trigger a rebalance.

Rebalancing itself costs capital through:

- gas;
- swap costs;
- price impact;
- forgone fee time;
- inventory transformation.

The engine therefore evaluates whether repositioning is economically justified.

A conceptual rule is:

```text
Expected Improvement From Repositioning
>
Estimated Cost of Repositioning + Safety Margin
```

### Safety

Liquidity management can be paused when:

- reference data becomes unsafe;
- the underlying asset halts;
- unexplained DEX/reference divergence becomes excessive;
- volatility exceeds configured limits;
- chain or RPC conditions are unstable;
- a global risk breaker is active.

The initial version is intentionally narrow: one Stock Token, one stablecoin, and one concentrated-liquidity venue before broader expansion.

---

# 07 · Risk and Execution Architecture

## 7.1 Why Risk Is Independent

Autonomous systems should not be able to silently redefine their own capital constraints.

This is why Blackwood separates strategy logic from risk authority.

A strategy proposal might look like:

```text
Asset: AAPL Stock Token
Action: Buy
Size: $2,500
Reason: Statistical dislocation
Expected Edge: 0.74%
```

The Risk Engine does not care that the strategy is confident.

It evaluates whether the action is allowed under current system state.

## 7.2 Common Risk Checks

Before approval, Blackwood can evaluate:

### Asset Validity
Is the token the canonical supported asset?

### Strategy State
Is this strategy enabled?

### Asset State
Is this asset currently enabled for execution?

### Exposure
Would the trade exceed strategy or protocol exposure limits?

### Capital
Does the execution wallet have sufficient available balance?

### Liquidity
Can the intended size be executed within acceptable market impact?

### Slippage
Is estimated slippage inside configured tolerance?

### Reference State
Is the reference price recent, coherent, and safe?

### Market State
Is the market session compatible with the strategy?

### Infrastructure
Are RPC, data providers, and chain connectivity operating within acceptable parameters?

### Simulation
Does the exact transaction simulate successfully?

## 7.3 Strategy-Specific Risk

Different strategies require different constraints.

Mean reversion may require strict reference-state validity and maximum holding duration.

Cross-pool arbitrage may require minimum expected net profit, atomic route support, and exact transaction simulation.

Adaptive liquidity may require volatility constraints, acceptable reference divergence, and positive rebalance economics.

A shared Risk Engine does not mean every strategy receives identical rules.

It means all risk rules are enforced through the same authority boundary.

## 7.4 Circuit Breakers

Blackwood can maintain multiple levels of circuit breaker.

```text
GLOBAL
  ├── MEAN REVERSION
  ├── CROSS-POOL
  ├── ADAPTIVE LIQUIDITY
  └── ASSET-SPECIFIC
```

A breaker may activate because of:

- maximum daily loss;
- oracle or reference failure;
- market halt;
- repeated transaction failures;
- abnormal price disagreement;
- RPC instability;
- wallet-balance inconsistency;
- manual emergency action.

A system that can act autonomously must also be capable of stopping autonomously.

## 7.5 Revalidation Before Signing

Risk approval is not necessarily the final check.

Critical market conditions should be re-evaluated immediately before signing.

This reduces the chance that an action approved under one state is executed after that state has materially changed.

## 7.6 Post-Trade Accounting

After settlement, Blackwood records:

- transaction hash;
- executed amount;
- effective execution price;
- fees and gas;
- position change;
- realized or unrealized PnL where applicable;
- strategy state;
- execution timestamp;
- relevant market-state snapshot.

This creates a traceable lifecycle from signal to settlement.

# 08 · Robinhood Chain and Stock Token Markets

## 8.1 Why Robinhood Chain

Blackwood is initially designed around Robinhood Chain because it brings together several components required for agentic tokenized-equity execution:

- an EVM-compatible onchain environment;
- Stock Token markets;
- programmable settlement;
- decentralized liquidity infrastructure;
- official market-data interfaces;
- onchain reference infrastructure;
- an ecosystem explicitly exploring agentic trading.

Robinhood has publicly introduced agentic trading products while expanding Stock Tokens and Robinhood Chain. That convergence makes the network a natural first environment for Blackwood's architecture.

## 8.2 Stock Token Data

Robinhood provides read-only Stock Token API endpoints for:

- asset metadata;
- underlying-market pricing;
- corporate-action information.

Blackwood can use these surfaces alongside onchain data to build a more complete representation of market state.

The important architectural point is that each source has a specific role.

A raw underlying-equity quote should not be treated as identical to an onchain token reference or an executable DEX price.

## 8.3 Onchain Liquidity

Uniswap infrastructure is available on Robinhood Chain across multiple protocol versions.

For Blackwood, this creates two distinct opportunities:

1. executable liquidity for normal strategy execution;
2. fragmented liquidity surfaces that can be analyzed by the Cross-Pool Arbitrage Agent.

The system intentionally distinguishes direct AMM liquidity from intent-based routing or auction systems.

## 8.4 Onchain Reference Infrastructure

Onchain reference data allows automated systems and smart contracts to consume external market information.

Reference data is not treated as infallible.

Blackwood monitors freshness, relevant state flags, and cross-surface consistency before allowing strategies that depend on the reference to execute.

---

# 09 · Capital Architecture

## 9.1 Initial Model

Blackwood's initial architecture uses protocol-operated strategy capital.

Each autonomous strategy can operate through a dedicated execution wallet or isolated capital domain.

For example:

```text
BLACKWOOD CAPITAL
      │
      ├── Mean Reversion Wallet
      │
      ├── Cross-Pool Wallet
      │
      └── Adaptive Liquidity Wallet
```

This provides operational separation without introducing unnecessary pooled-capital infrastructure at launch.

## 9.2 No Public Vault at Launch

The initial system does not require:

- ERC-4626;
- public pooled deposits;
- strategy-share accounting;
- unrestricted user deposits;
- vault-level withdrawal mechanics.

Those components solve a different problem: external capital ownership and accounting.

Blackwood's first objective is to prove the market-state, strategy, risk, and execution architecture itself.

## 9.3 Future Capital Layer

If Blackwood later supports externally supplied capital, that system should be introduced as a dedicated capital layer.

Such an architecture could include:

- onchain deposit accounting;
- strategy shares;
- withdrawal mechanics;
- strategy-level allocation;
- capital permissions;
- user-visible accounting.

The capital layer should remain separate from the core agent intelligence and execution architecture.

# 10 · Security, Reliability, and Operational Controls

## 10.1 Separation of Concerns

Blackwood separates:

```text
Frontend
API
Autonomous Worker Runtime
Database
Execution Wallets
Onchain Contracts
```

A failure in the public application interface should not automatically stop the strategy runtime.

Likewise, an internal strategy process should not require direct public network exposure.

## 10.2 Key Management

Execution keys should never be exposed to the frontend.

The browser can interact with authenticated application APIs, while signing authority remains isolated within the execution environment.

Operational controls should include:

- restricted environment access;
- encrypted secret storage;
- least-privilege permissions;
- key rotation procedures;
- withdrawal safeguards;
- manual emergency controls.

## 10.3 Infrastructure Isolation

The public API and autonomous worker serve different roles.

```text
PUBLIC INTERNET
      ↓
Frontend
      ↓ HTTPS
API
      ↓
Database / Internal Services

Private Worker Runtime
      ↓
Market Data + RPC
      ↓
Execution Wallet
      ↓
Robinhood Chain
```

The worker itself does not require a public application port.

## 10.4 Monitoring

Blackwood does not require heavyweight infrastructure to begin operating safely.

The initial monitoring stack can include:

- structured logs;
- process supervision;
- automatic restart;
- transaction-failure alerts;
- circuit-breaker alerts;
- wallet-balance monitoring;
- RPC-health monitoring;
- Telegram or Discord operational alerts.

The architecture can expand as execution volume and capital requirements grow.

## 10.5 Failure Isolation

A failure in one agent should not automatically propagate to every other agent.

Strategy-level isolation, separate capital domains, and strategy-specific circuit breakers allow the system to degrade selectively rather than fail as one monolithic process.

# 12 · Conclusion

Tokenization is changing the structure of financial markets.

When equities move onchain, assets become accessible to programmable liquidity, machine-readable market state, smart-contract settlement, and continuously operating systems.

At the same time, agentic systems are evolving from analytical tools into active market participants.

The combination creates a new infrastructure requirement.

An agent needs more than a model.

It needs market state.

It needs execution-aware intelligence.

It needs deterministic risk.

It needs simulation.

It needs settlement.

It needs infrastructure capable of deciding not only **what could be done**, but whether capital **should be allowed to do it**.

Blackwood Protocol is being built around that transition.

The initial network combines three distinct forms of autonomous execution: statistical convergence, fragmented-liquidity routing, and adaptive liquidity deployment. Each agent operates independently, but none operates alone.

They share the same market reality.

They share the same risk boundary.

They share the same execution infrastructure.

That is the larger idea behind Blackwood.

Not one trading bot.

Not one strategy.

Not one model with unrestricted control over capital.

A coordinated execution network built for autonomous market participants.

Tokenization made the assets programmable.

Blackwood is building for the point where market participation becomes programmable too.

> **Markets were built for people.  
> The next generation will be built for agents.**
